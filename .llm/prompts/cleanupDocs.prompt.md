Archive the memory.md and todo.md files by moving them to an archive folder with a timestamp. Then create new, empty memory.md and todo.md files to start fresh for the next part of the project. Include the headers from both files in the new files so that the llm can use those strings to know generally what has been done and also so they can search the archived docs if they need more detail. In the memory docs, carry over any important information with detail if you see fit, like make commands for build/test or important architectural decisions that will help the llm going forward. In the todo file, carry over any incomplete tasks that were not finished in the last phase.
