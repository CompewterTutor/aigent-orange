## TODO Creation
```
Using the guidelines laid out in the @guidelines file, create a todo list in the @todos markdown file with checkboxes for each task, split up by features as the headers.
```

## Coding Process
```
Continue working on the project in @project_folder. Follow the development guidelines in @development guidelines, and remember everything in @memory. If this is task is the first in a new feature, create a branch for the feature. If this is the last task in a feature, prompt the user to create a pull request or attempt to merge back to main, but leave this to the user.
