## TODO Creation
```
Using the guidelines laid out in the @guidelines file, create a todo list in the @todos markdown file with checkboxes for each task, split up by features as the headers.
```

## Starting from Brief
review the dev guidelines, then review the brief.md file in llm_brain. I want you to fill out the rest of brief after reviewing all the code in the project. I'd like you to then create a best practices document in the llm_brain folder for woocommerce child theme development. I'd then like you to create a todo list to work on a refactor of the plugin so that it meets proper enterprise level development standards for code quality, security, and developer experience. I'd like to create a new refactor branch to work in. I'd like to create some tools that will help dev, like a build tool, a make file with common commands for testing, linting, building(minify, etc), and a bump_version script that will change all version strings in the project to their proper values according to the project and the most recent storefront theme.Before you create this stuff I'd like you to fill out the todo.md file in llm_brain so that we have a project plan with that info and any suggestions you have that I will review and make decisions on whether or not to keep them in the todo and then take notes on the whole project in the memory file. Add your changes to a changelog.md file. Edit the readme with a proper readme and then commit the changes with a proper commit msg. We will begin the first task in the next chat.

## Coding Process
```
Continue working on the project in @project_folder. Follow the development guidelines in @development guidelines, and remember everything in @memory. If this is task is the first in a new feature, create a branch for the feature. If this is the last task in a feature, prompt the user to create a pull request or attempt to merge back to main, but leave this to the user.
