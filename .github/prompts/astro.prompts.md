# Astro Prompts

- "Generate an Astro component that renders a blog post preview with image, title, excerpt, and accessible markup. Use TypeScript and Content Layer types."
- "Explain hydration strategies in Astro and recommend when to use client:idle vs client:visible for performance-sensitive widgets."
- "Migrate a React component that uses client-side state to an Astro island with minimal client JS."
- "Write a Content Layer schema for blog posts with frontmatter fields: title, date, tags, draft, and hero image."
- "Provide a checklist to optimize an Astro site for Lighthouse performance (images, fonts, CSS, server response)."
