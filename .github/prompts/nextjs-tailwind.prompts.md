# Next.js + Tailwind Prompts

- "Create a Next.js App Router page that fetches markdown posts from the filesystem, renders them with Tailwind styles, and uses edge runtime caching."
- "Refactor this component (paste) into a server component and move interactive parts to a client component. Document prop types."
- "Add a Tailwind configuration that enables JIT, custom color tokens, and safe-list classes for dynamic usage."
- "Produce accessible form components using Headless UI and Tailwind that validate with Zod and show error UIs."
