# Go Development Instructions

Follow idiomatic Go practices and community standards when writing Go code. These instructions are based on [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go), [Go Code Review Comments](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments), and [Google's Go Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/).

## General Instructions

- Write simple, clear, and idiomatic Go code
- Favor clarity and simplicity over cleverness
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Keep the happy path left-aligned (minimize indentation)
- Return early to reduce nesting
- Prefer early return over if-else chains; use `if condition { return }` pattern to avoid else blocks
- Make the zero value useful
- Write self-documenting code with clear, descriptive names
- Document exported types, functions, methods, and packages
- Use Go modules for dependency management
- Leverage the Go standard library instead of reinventing the wheel (e.g., use `strings.Builder` for string concatenation, `filepath.Join` for path construction)
- Prefer standard library solutions over custom implementations when functionality exists
- Write comments in English by default; translate only upon user request
- Avoid using emoji in code and comments

## Naming Conventions

### Packages

- Use lowercase, single-word package names
- Avoid underscores, hyphens, or mixedCaps
- Choose names that describe what the package provides, not what it contains
- Avoid generic names like `util`, `common`, or `base`
- Package names should be singular, not plural

#### Package Declaration Rules (CRITICAL):
- **NEVER duplicate `package` declarations** - each Go file must have exactly ONE `package` line
- When editing an existing `.go` file:
  - **PRESERVE** the existing `package` declaration - do not add another one
  - If you need to replace the entire file content, start with the existing package name
  - When creating a new `.go` file:
  - **BEFORE writing any code**, check what package name other `.go` files in the same directory use
  - Use the SAME package name as existing files in that directory
  - If it's a new directory, use the directory name as the package name
  - Write **exactly one** `package <name>` line at the very top of the file
  - When using file creation or replacement tools:
  - **ALWAYS verify** the target file doesn't already have a `package` declaration before adding one
  - If replacing file content, include only ONE `package` declaration in the new content
  - **NEVER** create files with multiple `package` lines or duplicate declarations

## Code Style and Formatting

### Formatting

- Always use `gofmt` to format code
- Use `goimports` to manage imports automatically
- Keep line length reasonable (no hard limit, but consider readability)
- Add blank lines to separate logical groups of code

### Comments

- Strive for self-documenting code; prefer clear variable names, function names, and code structure over comments
- Write comments only when necessary to explain complex logic, business rules, or non-obvious behavior
- Write comments in complete sentences in English by default
- Translate comments to other languages only upon specific user request
- Start sentences with the name of the thing being described
- Package comments should start with "Package [name]" 
- Use line comments (`//`) for most comments
- Use block comments (`/* */`) sparingly, mainly for package documentation
- Document why, not what, unless the what is complex
- Avoid emoji in comments and code

## Architecture and Project Structure

### Package Organization

- Follow standard Go project layout conventions
- Keep `main` packages in `cmd/` directory
- Put reusable packages in `pkg/` or `internal/`
- Use `internal/` for packages that shouldn't be imported by external projects
- Group related functionality into packages
- Avoid circular dependencies
